# Lab 1 - *Tumblr Feed*

**Name of your app** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: 4.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [  ] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **optional** user stories are implemented:

- [  ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [  ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [  ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [  ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [  ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
From some reason I cannot defualt my app to Iphone7 and when it is in Iphone8 mode the app does not look that balanced, furthermore I would like to space out the images from each other.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
1. Where the outlets should go and to make sure to remove the outlet from the path not just the code.
2. We could add the the name the of the post photo so maybe we could be able to search for a certain photo.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

While bulding this app I had trouble posting the photo because I made a mistake on the connecting the outlets to the code. Another problem was the my UIImageView was not displaying properly.
